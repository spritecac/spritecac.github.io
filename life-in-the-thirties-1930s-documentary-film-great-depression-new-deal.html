A man puts up a closing sign. The 1930s are upon us and it is the Great Depression. The Great Depression began with the Wall Street Crash in October 1929 and marked a time of high unemployment, poverty, low profits, deflation, plunging farm incomes and economic growth. A man wears a sign: unemployed, will take any job. Men stand around, no money, no jobs. Bread line. Farmers talk, men stand and stare at him. A flyer calls for a strike. People rally, farmers grab guns, jump on a truck, break through a group of people and then pour milk out onto the ground (1:23-4:04). U.S. Capitol building. WW1 veterans march on Washington, they want their benefits. Troops disperse their rally. White House. President Hoover. Men sit in parks all day long, out of work, despondent. People go to banks and withdraw everything, not everyone can as is there is no money left. On the eve of the presidential election in 1932, the financial system is in great peril. People march and protest Hoover. President Elect Franklin D. Roosevelt rides with Hoover in a car to the former’s inauguration, they barely speak. The first inauguration for Franklin D. Roosevelt as the 32nd President of the United States on March 4, 1933.  People cheer as the car drives by (4:05-8:49). U.S. Capitol at night. Roosevelt doesn’t attend the Inaugural Ball, he goes right to work. Newspaper headlines show Roosevelt’s attempt at improving things immediately. He closes all banks for March 6-9, 1933. Signs show that people still sell goods and people can return and pay later. Roosevelt addresses the nation in a Fireside Chat. Trains ride the rails. Economists head to Washington, D.C. At the White House, Roosevelt surrounds himself with Raymond Moley, Rexford G. Tugwell, &amp;  Adolf Berle. They are part of Roosevelt’s new Brain Trust. Through 100 historic days, all New Deal measure passes without question. Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace, Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins. A hand bangs a gavel, letters open. . General Hugh S. Johnson, head of the NRA ( National Recovery Organization ).  Will Rogers supports the NRA. General Hugh S. Johnson gives a speech to the people (8:50-14:47). A ticker tape parade for the NRA, people gather, people seem hopeful. Utah repeals Prohibition on December 5, 1933. Beer is back, real beer.
