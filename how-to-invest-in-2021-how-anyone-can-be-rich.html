Budget &amp; track your spending, build a good credit score &amp; understand the different types of debt.<br /><br />Step 2: Minimising Taxes<br /><br />When it comes to investing, in most cases you are required to pay taxes on the profits you make, this is called capital gains tax, and is between 10 &amp; 20% depending on your income. You also have to consider your tax bracket as this can have a huge effect on how much you have to pay to the tax man, at the end of the year.<br /><br />It’s really important to minimise the tax you pay in these areas, so you are able to invest more for your future. There are 2 really simple ways you can take action… First is to Open up a tax advantaged account and second is to start some kind of side hustle or business which lets you write off your expenses.<br /><br />Step 3: Investing Strategies <br /><br />It’s extremely important to research any investment before throwing your money in. Sorry to state the obvious but the whole point of investing is to put your money to work for you and make money… So investing with no understanding of where your money is going is about as good as a spin on the slot machines.. <br /><br />Investment 1: Index Funds<br /><br />An index fund simply put is a basket of stocks, so instead of buying hundreds of stocks separately and having to manage them all at once, you can buy into a simple low cost index fund.<br /><br />Investment 2: Yourself with a side hustle or further education. <br /><br />Starting a side hustle has limitless potential returns, which is exactly what you want when trying to build wealth. A business on the other hand is obviously much higher risk as you may need to raise funding like on Shark Tank, but often a side hustle can lead to a profitable business later on.<br /><br />Investment 3: Individual Stocks<br /><br />An individual stock is investing into one specific company, for example Amazon stock would be considered an individual stock. The returns can be higher as it brings more exposure to one investment, but stocks can go either way, so only invest in Individual stocks with high conviction.<br /><br />Investment 3: Real estate<br /><br />Real Estate is a great way to accelerate wealth and often performs well during inflation. You can also invest in real estate through the form of a REIT which stands for Real Estate Investment Trust. This essentially means you can buy into other people’s real estate via the stock market and get a share of the rent. It’s usually commercial properties like shopping centres.<br /><br />Investment 4: Crypto (Bitcoin/Ethereum)<br /><br />Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin specifically has been the best performing asset over the last decade. Investor returns have been absolutely through the roof, but it hasn’t been an easy ride, it’s not uncommon to wake up one day and have half of your investment completely wiped out due to it being such a young type of investment, and it’s market volatility, that’s why I’ve put Crypto as high on the risk scale.<br /><br />Step 4: Picking Your Investments<br /><br />NOW IT’S TIME TO MAKE YOUR BIG DECISION, COMMENT DOWN BELOW WHAT YOU WOULD INVEST $1,000 IN!<br /><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><br />CONTACT:<br />For business inquires only, please use this email: mark@marktilburycoaching.com<br /><br />*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Mark Tilbury will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
