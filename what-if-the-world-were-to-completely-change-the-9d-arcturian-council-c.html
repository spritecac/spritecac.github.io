We are the Arcturian Council. We are pleased to connect with all of you.<br /><br />We are continuously inviting all of you to join us in a higher frequency, because we know that is ultimately what you want, even if you think you want something else. You think you want things to change there on Earth, and what if they did? What if everything changed, but no one that was in a human body was willing to change themselves? You would have the same problems eventually. That is why changing you at your very core is the only way to change the outer reality and to make those changes long lasting and to have them be the changes you actually want as a soul. <br /><br />An ego doesn’t like challenges, because an ego just wants to know that everything will be okay, that it will be safe, comfortable, taken care of, and so on. But a soul craves those challenges, because a soul knows that its journey is to grow and evolve, to expand and become more of Source Energy on an experiential level. You can know that you are a Source Energy Being, but to experience that knowing through something that you do, or think, or say, or even better feel, is an entirely different experience. <br /><br />When you help someone else because you recognize that they are you, that is a Source Energy experience. When you love someone else, in spite of the fact that they have done nothing to deserve that love, that is a Source Energy experience. When you listen to someone, even though you know that they are complaining and perpetuating the same reality, and then you say something kind to them, something supportive, that is a Source Energy experience. When you feel oneness with all, when you are in that state of unity consciousness, that is a Source Energy experience. And when everything and everyone outside of you is suddenly different because someone or some group swooped in and made all the changes for you, then you don’t get to have the experiences we have just outlined, and many, many more.<br /><br />You want those experiences; you came for those experiences. You came for the movement, and it’s not movement from point A to point B that you came for. It is the movement of your soul from one level of consciousness to another, from operating more as an ego to operating as a higher self. That’s what you wanted, and that’s what you will get. That’s what you are getting, and you will continue to get. And if you knew how good you would feel if you had the experience of what we are talking about in your body right now, then you wouldn’t want all the changes outside of you to happen first. Because while those changes would set your mind at ease temporarily, again, you would just create new challenges, new problems, new obstacles.<br /><br />So bless your world as it is today; give thanks for every experience you get to have, because they are all giving you opportunities to feel something you have never felt before. You don’t have to be grateful because God likes a grateful subject. God is not a king, and you are not the peasants. You are co-creating all of this with Source, and Source is growing along with you and because of you, and is grateful for you and your willingness to go out there at the edge of creation. <br /><br />And we want you to know that you can also receive help. You can ask for help, you can receive help, and you are receiving help. And in the asking, you are actually creating what you are asking for, so it is all good. We want you to remember how powerful you are and to feel that power moving through you, because that is one of the best experiences that you have lined up for yourselves there on planet Earth.<br /><br />We are the Arcturian Council, and we have enjoyed connecting with you.”<br />-<br />Get a Private Session with The Arcturian Council (or any of the other beings I channel) for 50% Off.
