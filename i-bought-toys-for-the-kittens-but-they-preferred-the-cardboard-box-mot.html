However, they preferred to play with cardboard boxes instead of playing with toys. But there was something they didn’t know. No matter how many cats. The cardboard boxes that come to this house have only one owner. One-eyed rescued tabby cat, Pirate. At the end of the day, the kittens ate the homemade yogurt made by my wife with pleasure. Meow. #kittenrescue #catrescue #adorablepaws #luckypaws<br /><br />Summary of the story: The kittens’ mothers has been missing. I must be their mother for a while. I continue to be a mother to motherless kittens. Kittens think I am their own mother. I’m about to really believe that I’m their mother.<br /><br />I found the kittens you watched in this video on the exit ramp of the parking garage of a site. Most likely, the mother cat gave birth to these kittens in the parking garage. Once the kittens are large enough, she may have wanted to move them to the garden. However, we never heard from the mother cat afterward. We moved the kittens to a safe area, as the place I found them was a very dangerous place. Not too far away. I carried them to my garden. Only 30 meters away.<br /><br />They were 6-8 weeks old when I found the kittens. I left the kittens in the garden, thinking about the possibility of the mother cat returning. I built a cat house for kittens. I fed the kittens at intervals of 4 hours. I feed the kittens with breast-milk substitutes, wet cat food, dry cat food and water. And with love. I helped them with their toilet needs. <br /><br />They’ve been vet checked. Everything was fine. Except for the one thing missing from this happy family picture. Me and the kittens were looking forward to the mother cat’s return. <br /><br />After about a week of waiting, we had to give up hope on the mother cat. It was also a very long time. The rain was approaching. Also, some of our neighbors were feeding the kittens incorrectly. Even if they wanted to do good, they could do them bad. And finally we decided to take the kittens our home. The health conditions of the kittens who have lived in our house for a long time are excellent. Now I have designed a room in my office for them. They live there and enjoy life. They can’t wait to meet new families to adopt kittens before winter ends.<br /><br />Why did I take the kittens to the office? Unfortunately, the disease of the sick cat Asya, who lives in our house, has progressed. Cat with heart disease and partial paralysis. I had to think about my daughter’s health.<br /><br />Do you know that all the cats living in our house were rescued from the street and adopted? Deaf cat, Jennefer. One-eyed cat, Pirate. Paralyzed cat, Asia. The cat with the broken jaw, Lola.<br /><br />Motherhood entails great responsibility. If you are a mother, you should take care of your babies 24 hours a day. Since we first met, kittens have thought of me as their own mother. Now I’m starting to believe that too. These kittens are always hungry. They are literally monsters. I feed these kittens every 6 hours. With breast-milk substitutes, dry cat food and wet cat food. All kittens were health checked. They now recognize my voice. It will be enough for them to hear my voice to come out of the cat house.<br /><br />Food list for kittens:<br /><em>At night, the food menu usually consists of dry cat food. Hearing this crunchy cat food sound every night is priceless.<br /></em>In the morning, it’s time for kittens to drink breast-milk substitutes.<br /><em>At noon, we have wet cat food on our menu for kittens.<br /></em>You can drink fresh water every hour in our menu.<br />*Unlimited love after every meal.<br /><br />Greetings from Adorable Paws. There are many stray cats living in our country. We have a dream. We established this channel to make this dream come true. Building a natural habitat for homeless animals. We are just at the beginning of the road. We believe we will make this dream come true one day.
