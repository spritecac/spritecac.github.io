As Voted for by You!<br /><br />So, having checked through all the great comments you have been leaving us, and to mark our momentous rise to 10k subscribers we have created a definitive list of your top-10 favourite cannabis strains.<br /><br />At number 10 on the list you voted for Train Wreck, though starting out with a Train Wreck may not seem such a smart move, especially if you enjoy travel!<br /><br />This one’s popular because of the powerful high and few negative side-effects. It seems to have a reputation for generating creativity and many comment that it has helped migraines, general pain and arthritis.<br /><br />Gelato comes in at number 9 with a word of caution for the uninitiated as this has a pretty powerful hit. Physical relaxation seems to be the overarching theme, while the ability to still function normally is a definite upside.<br /><br />Sitting at number 8 on the list, Stardawg is a winner with those of you who are looking for a good THC level. At around 20% you guys seem to feel that this is a good choice for those of you suffering from fatigue, stress or anxiety.<br /><br />At number 7 Future # 1 seems to hit the mark with those of you who are looking for something that leaves you feeling seriously relaxed, apparently also helping to reduce feelings of depression. A few of you mentioned the word chocolate, and not just because of an attack of the munchies.<br />Onto number 6 we have Amnesia Haze! So how did it get its name? Maybe because it is high in THC and low in CBD levels? The citrussy notes seem to go down well with you, as does the boost of energy that gets delivered.<br /><br />Northern lights seems to be another very popular choice with you and the enters the list at number 6, perhaps because of its potential to reduce stress and counteract sleeplessness. The slightly lower THC level makes this one more soporific and more likely to create a feeling of blissfulness.<br />We’re beginning to detect a theme here as this is another great strain that apparently induces a great feeling of being relaxed and happy. Rumour has it that this plant will also flower after just 45 days, which is pretty quick in our opinion, so maybe a good variety for those of you who are impatient!<br /><br />Girl Scout Cookies makes it comfortably onto the list at number 4 thanks to its ability to help users deal with pain, while providing a full-body hit of relaxation and mind-bending euphoria.<br />At number 3 we have Gorilla Glue, also known as GG4, has won many awards across the globe, and is clearly a big hit with you as well. This is one of those highly potent strains that helps to deliver a thumping dose of euphoria and relaxation which will leave you feeling “glued” to whatever you are sitting or lying on.<br /><br />Bruce Banner is up near the top of our list at number 2 and works quickly with a heavy hit that then settles down into a euphoric and creative buzz. It also seems to be popular with daytime users.<br />Before we move onto the coveted top spot voted by you, it would only be right to mention a few honourable entries<br /><br />Sour Diesel didn’t quite make it to the list but deserves an mention through its ability to make users feel uplifted, euphoric and generally happy, while still feeling full of energy. Your comments also indicate potential for helping with stress and depression.<br />We also couldn’t completely leave out Ghost train Haze, primarily because of the reports of it inducing a strong sense of creativity and ability to still concentrate heavily. Some of you also mentioned about its possible help with pain and depression, but those prone to anxiety should give this one a pass.<br /><br />So, back to it and the clear winner is….<br /><br />Wedding Cake -  An unforgettable journey into the land of delight begins with a single taste of this Indica dominant SUPER POTENT fiend of a strain. Its family line oozes sweet and sour earthy scents with unmistakable vanilla aromas and old skunky undertones. It would seem that this one delivers the strongest high, followed by a deep and overwhelming sense of relaxation. <br /><br />Now, isn’t that what many of us are looking for, apart from loose change down the back of the sofa! <br />And there you have it!
