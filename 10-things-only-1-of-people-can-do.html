No, not the filthy rich, but the real one percenters. Those people with special abilities that only a few can do. Abilities that can defy imagination, like number one. If you have that ability, I salute you. Stay tuned to find out what that id. Here are 20 things only 1% of people can do.<br /><br />Raise One Eyebrow<br />If you are a wrestling fan or have been a wrestling fan at one point in your life, chances are you’ve tried at least once to imitate the most electrifying man in all of entertainment, and raise one eyebrow. Yep, it’s kind of the Rock’s shtick for years. If you find yourself unable to do so, don’t fret, because you belong to the majority.<br />A study conducted by Chris Code from the university of Sydney, and yes somebody actually took the time, and got paid, to do a study on this thing. He found that less than a quarter of the population can do it. Now, that’s definitely more than one percent but given the billions of people in earth, if you can do it, you’re one of the chosen few. <br /><br />Bend Your Thumbs Backward<br />This is equally gross and amazing. If you find yourself able to bend your thumbs backwards, you have hitchhiker’s thumb. And if you have hitchhiker’s thumb, then it’s a definite thing that somebody in your family has it too.<br />You see, hitchhikers thumb is genetic and can be passed down for generations. No worries though, if you or someone you know has this ability, it’s never painful and doesn’t have any adverse effects on the use of your hands.<br /><br />Perfect Pitch<br />Most of the music that I listen too are from the US. That’s why i found it really surprising that only 14% of Americans have perfect pitch. which is the ability to sing any musical note at will. It can be acquired though, but it will take years of intense musical training. However, if you speak Mandarin, then you already have a leg up.<br />According to a research by Professor Diana Deutsch, 605 of Mandarin speaking Chinese have this ability. She theorized that this is due to the fact that tones play a vital part in the Mandarin language.<br /><br />Roar Like a Lion<br />You heard me right. Some people can actually make a roaring noise in their head by tensing their jaws or ears. The even weirder thing is, each and every one of us comes fully equipped to do this ability.<br />There’s a small muscle in each of our ears called the tensor tympani. Its purpose is to deaden sound, usually when we are chewing. However, some of us have the unique ability to flex that muscle, and when they do, it causes an audible rumple that has been likened to a lion’s roar.<br /><br />Never Get A Headache<br />Many things can give us a headache. Mine would be a toddler that has just recently learned how to run and is constantly banging into things. Otherwise, it can also be caused by alcohol intake, stress, hormones, caffeine withdrawal, and a whole lot of other things. With the multitude of things that can cause this pain in our heads, it’s easy to think that everyone of us has had a headache at least once. Oh how wrong we are.<br />The truth is 5% of people will live out their lives without having a headache at least once. I kind of envy them and pity them at the same time. Agree with me or not, but one of the best things in the world is a head massage.<br /><br />Soap Dish<br />Do certain dishes taste like soap to you? If they do, don’t go blaming the dishwasher just yet, especially if the dish you just ate has cilantro in it. Apparently, to some people, cilantro can taste exactly like soap.<br />As it turns out, cilantro has a chemical that is also found as a byproduct in soap making. Most of us can’t detect this tastes, but somewhere in between 4-14% of people actually have the genes that can detect this taste.<br /><br />Move Your Ears<br />This act is so trivial you can be forgiven for thinking that everyone can do it. But the fact is, only about a fifth of the world population can actually do it. More so, 22% can move only one ear at a time, and 18% can move both ears at the same time.<br />People who have the ability to do this use weak, vestigial muscles that we inherited from the common ancestor of cats and humans, who even knew there was such a thing. Anyway, scientists say that this common ancestor was an animal that moved its ears freely just like cats do today.</p>
