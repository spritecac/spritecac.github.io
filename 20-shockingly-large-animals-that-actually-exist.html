                        <div class="py-1 d-md-block bwr" id="video-description"><p>There are scores of shocking animals in our planet, and yet a lot of us are inexplicably surprised when we come across a big creature that we’ve never seen or heard about before. But since there are over a million kinds of creature existing on Earth, some are abnormally large animals that actually exist, how do we expect to know them all?Every year, scientists keep on discovering new and even more obscure species of large creature, and they concede that modern science hasn’t cataloged all the existing animals, which leaves a lot of room for many bizarre and unique discoveries that are yet to be made.Therefore, here’s a list of some of the world’s largest animals that actually exist: <br />1. ZEUS:<br />Zeus, whose owners described as a very gentle giant, clinched the record for the world’s tallest dog of the Guinness Book of World Records. When standing on his hind legs, it measured a whopping 7 feet, 4 inches. Apparently his owners Denise and Kevin Doorlag, residents of Otsego, Michigan, received a lot of inquiries about whether or not there pet was actually a real horse!<br />2. THE GOLIATH FROG:<br />The Giant frog, or Goliath as it is called, is not really very scary, but having this monstrosity croak at you when you least expect it just might give you a mini heart attack! <br />The biggest frog that most people have ever encountered is about the size of a fist, but this froggy giant is over a foot long, and once it extends its legs, it’s even longer! BIG JAKE:<br />Though horses are usually big and most are taller than the average human, Big Jake is sure to take the cake. <br />3. HERCULES: <br />Think of cats and what comes to mind are the cute, fluffy, and domestic fur-balls as well as the other jungle wildcats such as tigers and lions, etc. The biggest of them all was previously the Siberian Tiger. <br />However, there’s still another wildcat who surpasses this ferocious and magnificent predator, the liger. Yes, that’s right, a LIGER. It is the progeny of a union between a female tiger and a male lion as opposed to the progeny of a male tiger and a female lioness called a tigon.<br />4. BLOSOM:<br />Blosom was officially recognized in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s tallest cow just before she passed on. <br />A Holstein cow weighs an average of 1500 pounds, but it came in at over 2000 pounds and measured an amazing 6 feet 4 inches. She was indeed the biggest of them all.<br />When it was found out that Blosom couldn’t give birth to calves her owner, Patty Meads-Hanson, opted to keep her on as a pet instead of sending her to be slaughtered. She later became the farm’s official greeter and quickly became famous for her unique size.<br />5. MEDUSA:<br />The Guinness World Record’s title for the world’s largest snake has been conferred to Madame Medusa – a python living in Kansas City, Missouri. <br />When Medusa was measured in 2011, she had an astonishing length of 25 feet 2 inches, taking ten men to hold her up so that she could be measured. Her typical fortnightly dinner is a forty pound deer!<br />6. LOLONG:<br />So crocs are typically biggish, right? But Lolong is in a class all on its own.<br />The immense-sized croc was caught in September 2011 in the Bunwan Creek located in the Philippine province of Agusan Del Sure. The daunting task was carried out by a joint team comprising of local residents, units from the local government, and crocodile hunters from the Palawan Wildlife Reservation Center.<br />7. BIG BILL:<br />Owned by Elias Buford Butler, Big Bill from Jackson, Tennessee holds the title of the world’s largest pig weighing in at a shocking 2,552 pounds. <br />Big Bill was awarded the title back in 1933 and was five feet tall and nine feet long. Up till date, no pig has ever approached his gigantic size.<br />8. BLUE WHALE:<br />This is the world’s largest existing animal and the heaviest animal that ever existed, weighing in at around 210 short tons and can grow up to 98 feet long.<br />Blue whales inhabit all of the Earth’s oceans and almost exclusively eat krill. They were heavily hunted, almost to the point of extinction, in fact, until whale hunting was outlawed in 1968 by the internal community. As a result, they are now endangered.<br />9. GREEN ANACONDA:<br />Although a reticulated python can grow a bit longer than a green anaconda, the 12-inches wide diameter of an anaconda’s body earns it the title of world’s largest snake. <br />They grow more than 29 feet long and can weigh more than 550 pounds, especially when they eat wild pigs, deer, and even jaguars.<br />Which one make you afraid?
