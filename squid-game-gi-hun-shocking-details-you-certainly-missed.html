      <td>Squid Game: The main content of the internet. The face of every meme. The thrilling drama has left fans everywhere captivated, with those who’ve binged the nine-episode series already coming up with their own theories about various aspects of the twisted thriller. That’s why it isn’t a huge question that more than a month after its initial release, the latest Netflix series is still dominating the internet, and it surprisingly remains the most talked about series. A captivating vision of a polarized society, Netflix’s newest smash hit is the latest manifestation of the ever-growing influence of South Korea’s popular culture, epitomized by K-Pop sensations, and the subtitled Oscar-winning film Parasite.<br /><br />Squid Game’s incredible blend of a colorful plot, social allegory, and uncompromising insanity completes South Korea’s latest culture phenomenon. But apart from the social realities that have been mirrored in the show, the storyline which followed the perspective of one gambling addict-slash-debt-inundated man deeply resonated with almost everyone. Perhaps, it might have been the contrast of fighting for your own gain and fighting for others that made the last episode, and the last game as well, to be the most exciting part of the series. Gi-hun, the main character and also known as player 456, has showcased that even on someone’s darkest and lowest days, there is still goodness that lives within people. Even at the end of the episode, he fought to prove that to the old man, Il-Nam, the games’ founder. Even though Sang Woo might have been the most relatable character among them all as he depicts the true nature of a man in need, deep inside our hearts, we have always saluted Gi-Hun for his pure kindness. However, there are some things that you may have missed in the series that weren’t originally meant to be noticed at first glance. And you might be surprised what they are! In today’s video, we’ll show you everything you need to know and may have missed about Squid Game’s main character Gi-hun, or the infamous Player 456. But before anything else, let me warn you again for the spoilers coming your way, and of course make sure to hit that subscribe button and notification bell first for more updates. Now, let the games begin!<br /><br />Squid Game’s first episode contains several clues about the fate of Gi-hun, which includes foreshadowing around his designation as Player 456. The survival drama pits 456 players against each other. They are motivated by Squid Game’s 45.6 billion won prize. Many of the competitors appear to have some level of addiction to gambling, but before the games even begin, Gi-hun is seen stealing money from his mother to bet on horses—and he wins. When Gi-hun collects his winnings, the total amounts to 45.6 million won. This is the first clue that Gi-hun, among the hundreds of players involved in Squid Game, will be assigned 456 as his player number, and later on to win the 45.6 billion won prize. The symbolism doesn’t end there. While Gi-hun is the last player chosen for the game, the first is Oh Il-nam, aka Player 001, with whom Gi-hun shares a close. In the final episode, Il-nam reveals to Gi-hun that he is not just any player, but the billionaire who founded Squid Game. Il-nam admits that he joined.<br /><br />At the heart of each episode is the story of Seong Gi-hun who hopes to win the competition to pay off his mom’s medical bills and be closer to his daughter. One of the biggest changes Gi-hun makes in the series is the spur-of-the-moment decision to dye his hair an uncharacteristic, fiery red. At the start of the competition, Gi-hun and the other players face off in a fatal game of Red Light, Green Light, in which he barely makes it out alive. Against the odds, Gi-hun is the only player. With all he fought for out of reach, Gi-hun leaves his fully-loaded bank card. After a chilling meeting with Oh Il-nam, the man behind the games, Gi-hun is able to fully process his grief and keeps his promises to help Song Sae-byeok’s little brother.<br /><br />Though he doesn’t die like the rest, Gi-hun’s future is also sort of predicted.<br /><br />Gi-hun’s home has a photo of Ga-yeong by herself, but her mother’s home has a picture of her with family. The photos may symbolize how different Ga-yeong’s relationships are with her parents.
