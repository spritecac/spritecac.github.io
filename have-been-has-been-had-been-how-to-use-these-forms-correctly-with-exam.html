These forms cause a lot of <br />confusion for many people. Well, in this video, I will clear up <br />that confusion. I’m going to teach you the three main uses of <br />these forms how to use them correctly without making mistakes. As <br />always, there is a quiz at the end of the video to test your <br />understanding. Alright, let’s get started. Before we talk about <br />the uses, you need to know the basics of where to use have, has <br />and had been: in the present, if the subject of a sentence is <br />I/You/We/They or a plural noun, then we use ‘have been’. If the <br />subject is He/She/It or a singular noun, then we use ‘has been’. <br />This is when we talk about the present. When we talk only about <br />the past, it’s very easy. For any subject, we use ‘had been’. OK, <br />let me test you: what do we use with He/She/It or a singular noun <br />in the present? We use ‘has been’. What about with I/You/We/They <br />or plural nouns? We use ‘have been’. And in the past tense? We use <br />‘had been’ for all subjects. Good, so let’s now look at the first <br />use of these forms. This is in the present perfect tense. That is, <br />to talk about actions or situations that started in the past and <br />are still continuing. Here’s an example: “I have been working as a <br />teacher for 7 years.” In speech, we usually shorten ‘I have’ to <br />‘I’ve’ – “I’ve been working as a teacher for 7 years.”  Let’s look <br />at a timeline for this. You know that I started working as a <br />teacher seven years ago (or in 2010 because at the time of filming <br />this video, right now, it’s 2017), and I’m still a teacher, so <br />this action – ‘working’ is continuing. In this sentence, we can <br />also say: “I have been working as a teacher since 2010.” The <br />difference between ‘for’ and ‘since’ is that if you want to <br />mention the duration (or amount of time), then you use ‘for’ (like <br />‘for 7 years’). If you want to mention the starting point of the <br />action or situation, use ‘since’ (as in ‘since 2010’). Here’s <br />another example: let’s say that this lady wants to see the doctor. <br />Her appointment was at 3 o’clock. She came to the hospital at 3, <br />but the doctor wasn’t there. So she started waiting at 3 o’clock <br />and she’s still waiting – let’s say it’s 5 o’clock now, so two <br />hours have passed. So what can we say? We can say: “She has been <br />waiting for two hours.” or “She has been waiting since 3 o’clock.” <br />In natural speech, we say he‘s been and she’s been: “She’s been <br />waiting”. OK have a look at this sentence: “He has been the CEO of <br />the company for four months” or we can say ‘since June’ because <br />that’s when he started. Here, we don’t have an –ing verb like <br />‘working’ or ‘waiting’. That’s because we don’t want to focus on <br />any action, we just want to express the situation – that he became <br />the CEO in June and he’s still the CEO. Here’s another example: <br />“They’ve been married for 25 years / since 1992.” When did they <br />get married? In 1992. Are they still married now? Yes. So, they’ve <br />been married for 25 years now. OK, so what about ‘had been’? Well, <br />let’s change our sentences a little bit:  “I had been working as a <br />teacher for 7 years when I quit my job.” Ah, we see a different <br />meaning here. It means that I started working as a teacher at some <br />point in the past, I was a teacher for 7 years, but then I quit. <br />So now, I am no longer a teacher. I want you to notice that there <br />are two past actions here: one continuous action (“I had been <br />working as a teacher”) and a single finished action at the end of <br />that (“I quit”). Compare this to the previous sentence – “I have <br />been working as a teacher” – here, there is only one continuous <br />action and it’s still continuing, it’s not finished. So, please <br />remember this rule: only use ‘had been’ if there were two events <br />in the past: a continuing action or a situation and a single, <br />finished action. So let’s go back to the other sentences. With <br />these, we can say: “She had been waiting for two hours when the <br />doctor finally arrived.” “He’d been the CEO of the company for <br />only four months when it went bankrupt.” ‘Went bankrupt’ means the <br />company lost all its money and closed down. “They had been married <br />for 25 years when they divorced.” So are they still married? <br />Unfortunately, no. Just like the sentences with ‘have been’ and <br />‘has been’ are in the present perfect tense, the sentences with <br />‘had been’ are in the past perfect tense.</p>
