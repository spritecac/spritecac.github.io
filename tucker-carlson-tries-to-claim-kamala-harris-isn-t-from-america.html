Please excuse any typos.<br /><br /><br />Tucker Carlson has decided to go the birther route with vice-president Kamala Harris. And this week actually questioned whether or not she was truly from the United States, but he did it in a different way. Not the same way they went after Obama with the birth certificate. Carlson tried to use the fact that she went to high school in Canada as proof that she somehow isn’t from America. Take a look at Carlson, explaining his logic here, here it is. <br /><br />I’m going to Harris. Most people probably don’t know. She really grew up in Canada. It’s where she went to high school. She’s not from this country in that sense, or she’s certainly also from Canada. Okay. Didn’t know that doesn’t mean she’s not gonna be a good vice president, but why haven’t we heard that by the way, how did <br /><br />We all know what this is? This is a nonwhite woman and that threatens Tucker Carlson, just like Barack Obama as a white man threatened all of Fox news for years and years. And so they push those baseless birther conspiracy saying he may have been born in Kenya. We haven’t seen the long form birth certificate, which we had in fact seen. And for the record, yes, both former president, Donald Trump and his wife Milania at the time also pushed the birther conspiracies. It was a way of signaling to their base. You know, a dog whistle of dog whistles. If you will, that this man or this woman in this instance who doesn’t look like you, can’t be trusted after all the tone of their skin is different. So we should question their motives. We should question where they’re from. This folks was good. Old fashioned racism coming from Tucker Carlson disguised his genuine concern about where vice president Kamala Harris actually comes from. <br /><br />Uh, she was born in California. She is a United States citizen. She did in fact go to high school in Montreal when her mother got a job up there as both a teacher and a cancer researcher. And then of course, for a time she actually attended boarding school in Switzerland Tucker. Oh my God. Well, I guess there’s the subject of your next mini documentary, trying to freak everybody out that Carla Harris could actually be from both Canada and Switzerland. This is ridiculous. This shows you that this network Tucker Carlson specifically has nothing of substance to go after this administration for they create these fake scandals. They put it out there saying, I’m just asking the questions. No you’re creating a new conspiracy is what you’re doing. You’re signaling to your base. That again, this woman that doesn’t look quite like you because their skin’s a little bit darker. <br /><br />So obviously she can’t be from America because we don’t have dark skinned people here. And the dumbest insinuations I have ever seen from Fox news, but Tucker Carlson took the mask off a long time ago, took the mask off and he put the hood on his program has openly supported white nationalist narratives. You know, the great replacement theory, which is total BS. He has said that immigrants make our country dirtier. If you just look at them, they’re actually dirty. He says, there is no question what Tucker Carlson was attempting to do here with these tax on attacks on vice president Harris. Now I am by no stretch of the imagination, the president of the vice president, Kamala Harris fan club. But if you want to critique her, if you want to criticize her, do it on policy, you attack somebody because of the color of their skin or from where they were born or where they went to high school. <br /><br />You’ve already lost the narrative and that’s a cheap shot and it’s a overwhelming dog whistle to your base. But the thing is Tucker Carson really has nothing to attack her on for policy after all. She is the vice-president. She has been given roles by the president of the United States, Joe Biden, as she is working on them. Has she achieved them yet? No, she hasn’t because she’s been in office for a little over 10 months now. Not exactly, you know, actually not even a little over 10 months, a little under 10 months.</p>
